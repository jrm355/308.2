// part 1
// Your task is to create a program that advises a group of environmental 
//scientists how to handle the growth and spread of a unique plant species under their supervision. 
//You must develop a growth control system that will monitor and predict the plant growth, 
//making decisions based on the available space and potential growth.

const PI = 3.1415;
const area = PI * radius * radius;

//weeks post planting

// area covered in plants
let a = plants

// The area in which the plants are contained is circular, with a radius of 5 meters

PI * 5 * 5 
//total radius
// = 78.5375

// Each plant requires a minimum space of 0.8 square meters.
const space = .8


//The area is starting with 20 plants.

const start = 20

//The plants double in number every week


//Predict the plant growth after a specific number of weeks.

let W = 1

(.8 * 20 * 2 ** W) = a
console.log (a)
// = area

// .8 is tree radius, 20 trees, growth rate of 2**2

//w is weeks planted


// Implement control flow to make decisions on whether the plants should be:
// This condition should be met if the plant count after the given number of weeks is greater than 80% of the maximum capacity of the garden.

if (78.5375 > .8 * a) {

//week 1 logged as planted
//week 2 logged as pruned
//weed 3 logged as pruned


// Part 2

// solve for radius
